## 1) What is DevOps, really?

At its core, DevOps is a **culture + set of practices** that integrates **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)** to shorten the software delivery lifecycle.  

Instead of working in silos, DevOps teams collaborate to **plan, build, test, deploy, and monitor software continuously.**
