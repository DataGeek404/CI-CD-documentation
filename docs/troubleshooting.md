# 7 Troubleshooting in CI/CD

## Overview

Even with a well-implemented CI/CD pipeline, issues can still arise during **builds, tests, deployments, or runtime operations**.  
**Troubleshooting** is the process of diagnosing and resolving these issues quickly to keep the pipeline running smoothly and ensure reliable software delivery.

A systematic troubleshooting approach allows teams to:
- Detect the root cause of failures.
- Reduce downtime and delivery delays.
- Prevent recurring issues.
- Improve pipeline resilience.

## Common Categories of CI/CD Issues

### 1. **Source Control Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Merge conflicts, missing commits, outdated branches.  
- **Causes:**
  - Poor branching strategy.
  - Long-lived feature branches.
  - Unresolved conflicts during merges.
- **Solutions:**
  - Adopt a clear branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow).
  - Rebase or merge frequently.
  - Use branch protection rules and automated checks.

---

### 2. **Build Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Compilation errors, dependency resolution failures, misconfigured build tools.  
- **Causes:**
  - Incorrect build scripts.
  - Missing dependencies or library version conflicts.
  - Environment mismatch (local vs. CI server).
- **Solutions:**
  - Ensure build scripts are version-controlled.
  - Use dependency management tools (npm, pip, Maven, Gradle).
  - Containerize builds (Docker) to ensure consistency.

---

### 3. **Test Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Unit, integration, or regression tests failing in pipeline.  
- **Causes:**
  - Flaky tests (inconsistent results).
  - Environment-specific issues.
  - Outdated or incomplete test data.
- **Solutions:**
  - Stabilize flaky tests by fixing timeouts or race conditions.
  - Mock external dependencies.
  - Use consistent test environments and seed data.
  - Automate reruns for flaky test detection.

---

### 4. **Deployment Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Failed deployments, missing environment variables, broken services.  
- **Causes:**
  - Misconfigured infrastructure (e.g., ports, networks).
  - Missing secrets or incorrect environment variables.
  - Artifact mismatch (wrong version deployed).
- **Solutions:**
  - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent environments.
  - Store artifacts in versioned repositories.
  - Automate secret management with Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets.
  - Implement rollback strategies (Blue-Green, Canary).

---

### 5. **Pipeline Performance Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Long build times, slow test execution, bottlenecks.  
- **Causes:**
  - Inefficient build or test scripts.
  - Lack of parallelization.
  - Large artifacts or dependency downloads.
- **Solutions:**
  - Cache dependencies and artifacts.
  - Split tests into parallel jobs.
  - Optimize build steps (incremental builds).
  - Use lightweight containers.

---

### 6. **Security & Compliance Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Vulnerability scans fail, secrets exposed in code, non-compliance with policies.  
- **Causes:**
  - Hardcoded credentials.
  - Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
  - Missing security scans in CI/CD.
- **Solutions:**
  - Integrate DevSecOps practices (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).
  - Rotate and secure credentials.
  - Enforce compliance checks as part of the pipeline.

## Troubleshooting Workflow

### Step 1: **Identify the Issue**
- Review pipeline logs (build logs, test reports, deployment logs).  
- Check monitoring dashboards and alerts.  
- Reproduce the error locally if possible.  

### Step 2: **Isolate the Problem**
- Determine if it’s code-related, infrastructure-related, or pipeline-related.  
- Compare failing builds with the last successful build.  
- Roll back recent changes to confirm.  

### Step 3: **Fix and Verify**
- Apply fixes incrementally.  
- Rerun the pipeline or specific failed stage.  
- Validate results with automated tests.  

### Step 4: **Document & Prevent Recurrence**
- Document root cause and resolution in the project’s knowledge base.  
- Add automated checks (linting, testing, scanning).  
- Improve monitoring and alerts for faster detection.
