# 4 (CI) Workflow

## Overview

A **Continuous Integration (CI) workflow** defines the process of automatically building, testing, and validating every change made to a codebase before it is merged.  
The goal of CI is to ensure that the application remains **stable, functional, and deployable** at all times by detecting issues early in the development cycle.

CI workflows are triggered whenever developers push changes to the **version control system (VCS)** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Automated pipelines then verify the integrity of the application.

## Objectives of a CI Workflow

- **Early Bug Detection:** Find and fix issues as soon as they are introduced.  
- **Automated Testing:** Run unit, integration, and regression tests automatically.  
- **Build Validation:** Ensure that code compiles and passes quality checks.  
- **Consistent Code Quality:** Enforce coding standards and style guidelines.  
- **Faster Feedback:** Provide immediate feedback to developers.  
- **Deployment Readiness:** Ensure every commit is potentially releasable.

## Key Stages of a CI Workflow

### 1. **Code Commit & Trigger**
- Developers commit changes to the **main repository**.
- Triggers can be:
  - **Push events** (code pushed to a branch).
  - **Pull/Merge requests** (opening or updating a PR).
  - **Scheduled jobs** (nightly builds).
- CI server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) detects the change.

---

### 2. **Source Retrieval**
- The pipeline checks out the latest code from the repository.  
- Dependencies and submodules are fetched.  
- Code versioning ensures reproducibility.

---

### 3. **Build Stage**
- Application is compiled or packaged.  
- Dependency management tools (Maven, Gradle, npm, pip, etc.) resolve and install libraries.  
- Generated artifacts may be stored in an **artifact repository** (e.g., JFrog Artifactory, Nexus).

---

### 4. **Static Code Analysis (Optional but Recommended)**
- Code is scanned for style violations, code smells, and potential bugs.  
- Tools: SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint, Checkstyle.  
- Helps enforce consistent coding standards.

---

### 5. **Automated Testing**
- **Unit Tests:** Validate individual components or functions.  
- **Integration Tests:** Check interactions between modules or services.  
- **Regression Tests:** Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.  
- **Security & Vulnerability Tests (DevSecOps):** Scan dependencies for known issues.  

> Tests are critical: if any fail, the workflow **fails immediately** and alerts the developer.

---

### 6. **Build Artifact Creation**
- Successful builds are packaged into deployable units:
  - JAR/WAR files (Java).
  - Docker images.
  - Python wheels.
  - Node.js bundles.
- These artifacts are stored for deployment in later stages.

---

### 7. **Reporting & Notifications**
- Developers are notified of build/test results via:
  - Emails.
  - ChatOps integrations (Slack, Microsoft Teams).
  - Dashboard visualization (Jenkins Blue Ocean, GitLab UI).  
- Clear feedback ensures faster resolution of issues.
