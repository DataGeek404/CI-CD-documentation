# 2. Architecture

## Overview

The **architecture of CI/CD** defines how code changes move seamlessly from development to production through an automated pipeline.  
It combines practices, processes, and tools that integrate software development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops), forming the backbone of the **DevOps culture**.

A typical CI/CD architecture ensures:
- **Automation** of builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Consistency** across environments (dev, staging, production).
- **Scalability** to handle growing teams and projects.
- **Monitoring & Feedback** loops for continuous improvement.

## Key Components of CI/CD Architecture

### 1. **Source Code Management (SCM)**
- **Purpose:** Central repository for storing, versioning, and managing code.
- **Examples:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
- **Practices:**
  - Branching strategies (GitFlow, trunk-based development).
  - Pull/Merge requests for peer reviews.
  - Hooks for triggering pipelines on code changes.

---

### 2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
- **Purpose:** Automates the integration of code into a shared repository.
- **Processes:**
  - **Build automation:** Compiling source code and resolving dependencies.
  - **Automated testing:** Running unit, integration, and regression tests.
  - **Artifact management:** Packaging code into deployable units (e.g., JARs, Docker images).
- **Tools:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI.

---

### 3. **Artifact Repository**
- **Purpose:** Stores build outputs (artifacts) for reuse and deployment.
- **Examples:** JFrog Artifactory, Nexus Repository, Docker Hub.
- **Benefits:**
  - Versioned storage of deployable builds.
  - Ensures consistency between environments.

---

### 4. **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**
- **Purpose:** Automates the release of tested code into staging and production.
- **Types:**
  - **Continuous Delivery:** Deployments to production require manual approval.
  - **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automated deployments with no manual steps.
- **Processes:**
  - Infrastructure provisioning (IaC).
  - Configuration management.
  - Canary releases, blue-green deployments, rolling updates.

---

### 5. **Environment Infrastructure**
- **Purpose:** Provides the execution environments for applications.
- **Key Elements:**
  - **Development Environment:** Local setups for coding and initial testing.
  - **Staging Environment:** A replica of production used for validation.
  - **Production Environment:** Live environment serving end-users.
- **Provisioning Tools:** Terraform, Ansible, AWS CloudFormation.

---

### 6. **Monitoring & Logging**
- **Purpose:** Tracks system health, performance, and failures after deployment.
- **Practices:**
  - Application Performance Monitoring (APM).
  - Error tracking and alerting.
  - Log aggregation and visualization.
- **Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog, New Relic.

---

### 7. **Feedback Loop**
- **Purpose:** Ensures continuous improvement by feeding runtime insights back to developers.
- **Examples:**
  - Error alerts triggering bug fixes.
  - Performance reports guiding optimization.
  - Security scans highlighting vulnerabilities.
